Brainstorming websites ideas for a websites I'm creating for a friend !!   

What Ithe website will Offer :
Stock Videos
   - A library of pre-made, high-quality videos catering to various interests and fetishes.  
   - These videos can focus on themes like burlesque-style sensuality, classy teasing, and elegant performance.  

2. **Custom Videos**  
   - Personalized videos by request, offering a unique and tailored experience.  
   - These will have less explicit sexual content compared to before, focusing more on sensual and artistic elements.  
   - Possible examples:  
      - Burlesque-style performances.  
      - Sensual, form-fitting outfits with a strong aesthetic appeal.  
      - Scenario-based storytelling (like roleplay or themed narratives).  

3. **Fetishes & Niche Interests**  
   - The stock library could also cater to specific fetishes in a tasteful and creative way.  
   - Ideas here can range from classic favorites to more imaginative concepts – we can list examples if needed to appeal to a broader audience.  

### **Visuals & Design Elements:**  
- **Backgrounds:**  
   - I’d love to incorporate masked images of myself as part of the site’s design. These can be used subtly in the background to add a personal touch while maintaining some mystery.  
   - I can send over some masked pics for you to experiment with if needed!  

### **Next Steps to Explore:**  
- Let me know if you’d like the masked photos to start playing around with the visuals.  
- We could explore how to integrate the burlesque/sensual themes into both the design and the copywriting.  
- Would love to hear your thoughts on how to best showcase stock vs. custom offerings. Maybe a clear section or toggle to navigate between the two?
